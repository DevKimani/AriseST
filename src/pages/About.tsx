            <h2>Turning Pain into Purpose</h2>
            <p>Arise Strong Together grew out of one survivor’s journey. Our founder lived through gender-based violence and, through specialised healing and GBV training, not only rebuilt her own strength but came to understand — firsthand — the gaps in the support available to others.</p>
            <p>That personal healing became the catalyst for something larger. She saw how many people in the community were caught in cycles of silence, without a safe space or the professional tools to recover. Determined that no one else should walk that path alone, she founded Arise Strong Together.</p>
            <p>What began as a personal mission to heal became a structured community movement. We formally registered as <strong>Arise Strong Together CBO in June 2025</strong> — a platform where counselling, advocacy, and empowerment meet. By combining professional counselling training with lived experience as a survivor, we approach every person with genuine empathy and expert guidance.</p>
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>To support survivors of gender-based violence to heal and reclaim their lives, and to work alongside women, youth, and the wider community to prevent violence and build a future free from GBV.</p>
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>A community — and a society — free from gender-based violence, where every person, especially women and youth, can live with dignity, safety, and opportunity.</p>
            <h2>Why We Rise</h2>
            <p>We exist to prove that healing is possible, and that community support is the bridge to a better future — helping others turn their experiences into strength so that, together, we can all arise.</p>
